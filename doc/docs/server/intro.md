# EchoKit Server

EchoKit Server is the central component that manages communication between the EchoKit device and AI services. It can be deployed locally or connected to preset servers, allowing developers to customize LLM endpoints, plan the LLM prompt, configure speech models, and integrate additional AI features like MCP servers.

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to set up and customize the EchoKit server. Specifically, we’ll cover how to:

* [Connect the Echokit device with the EchoKit server](./setup.md) 
* [Run the EchoKit server locally](./echokit-server.md)  
* Customize AI settings for the EchoKit server
