## Get familiar with the buttons

Let’s take a moment to get familiar with the common buttons and ports. The image below gives you a clear overview of them. Learn more about the buttons on Buttons on EchoKit Box.


## Step 1: Power up EchoKit

Use a **USB Type-C data cable** to connect EchoKit Box to a power source, such as a battery charger or your computer. The Type-C port is located on the **right side** of the device.



You will see the QR code display on the EchoKit screen. 


## Step 2: Connect EchoKit to Your Computer

Open a web browser on a desktop computer and go to:  
👉 [**https://echokit.dev/setup/**](https://echokit.dev/setup/)

> Make sure that your computer has Bluetooth turned ON.

Click **Connect to EchoKit** to begin Bluetooth pairing.




## Step 3: Configure Wi-Fi and Server

Once paired via Bluetooth, you’ll be redirected to a setup interface where you can enter:


- **Wi-Fi Network**: Your Wi-Fi network name. It MUST be a 2.4G network.  
- **Wi-Fi Password**: Your Wi-Fi access code  
- **EchoKit Server**: The IP and port of the EchoKit Server you're connecting to. You can use our hosted servers depending on your location:
    - 🇺🇸 US: `ws://indie.echokit.dev/ws`
    - 🇭🇰 Hong Kong: `ws://hk.echokit.dev/ws`
    - 🇸🇬 Singapore: TBD
- **Background Image**: Upload a transparent GIF image as the background for the device.

For each field, click the **"Write"** button on the web page after entering the value.

After you are done writing all fields, click **K0 button** on the EchoKit Box device, which located in the upside of the device.

## Step 4: Confirm Setup on EchoKit

Once configuration is complete, EchoKit will:

- Display a welcome screen  
- Play a voice greeting like: **"Hi there"**  
- Show a message like: **"Hello Set"**

This means your device is ready to use!


## Step 5: Start Chatting

Press the [**K0 button**] to start your conversation with EchoKit. The status bar at the top of the screen says "Listening ..." and it is ready to respond to you!


If it says "Idle" or "Speaking" in the status bar at the top of the screen, it cannot hear you and would not respond to you. ;) 
* When it's idle, press the K0 button to start chat mode.
* When it's speaking, wait until it finishes before talking.
