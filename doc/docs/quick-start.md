- **Wi-Fi Network**: Your Wi-Fi network name. It MUST be a 2.4G network.  
- **Wi-Fi Password**: Your Wi-Fi access code  
- **EchoKit Server**: The IP and port of the EchoKit Server you're connecting to. You can use our hosted servers depending on your location:
    - 🇺🇸 US: `ws://indie.echokit.dev/ws`
    - 🇭🇰 Hong Kong: `ws://hk.echokit.dev/ws`
    - 🇸🇬 Singapore: TBD
- **Background Image**: Upload a transparent GIF image as the background for the device.

For each field, click the **"Write"** button after entering the value.

After you are done writing all fields, click **K0 button** on the EchoKit device.

## Step 4: Confirm Setup on EchoKit

Once configuration is complete, EchoKit will:

- Display a welcome screen  
- Play a voice greeting like: **"Hi there"**  
- Show a message like: **"Background data loaded"**

This means your device is ready to use!

## Step 5: Start Chatting

Press the **K0 button** to start your conversation with EchoKit. The status bar at the top of the screen says "Listening ..." and it is ready to respond to you!

If it says "Idle" or "Speaking" in the status bar at the top of the screen, it cannot hear you and would not respond to you. ;)

Enjoy your voice AI journey.
