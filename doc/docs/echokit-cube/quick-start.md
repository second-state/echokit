# Quick Start with EchoKit Cube

This guide walks you through setting up your **EchoKit Cube**, which comes pre-assembled and ready to use.  

> If you would like to get a preview before your EchoKit device arrives, you can use our [web-based EchoKit device simulator](https://echokit.dev/chat/resources/).

## Get familiar with the buttons

Letâ€™s take a moment to get familiar with the common buttons and ports. The image below gives you a clear overview of them. Learn more about the buttons on Button on Buttons on EchoKit Cube.


## Step 1: Power up EchoKit

Use a **USB Type-C data cable** to connect EchoKit to a power source, such as a battery charger or your computer. The Type-C port is located on the **left side** of the device.



You will see the QR code display on the EchoKit screen. 


## Step 2: Connect EchoKit to Your Computer

Open a web browser on a desktop computer and go to:  
ðŸ‘‰ [**https://echokit.dev/setup/**](https://echokit.dev/setup/)

> Make sure that your computer has Bluetooth turned ON.

Click **Connect to EchoKit** to begin Bluetooth pairing.

- **Wi-Fi Network**: Your Wi-Fi network name. It MUST be a 2.4G network.  
- **Wi-Fi Password**: Your Wi-Fi access code  
- **EchoKit Server**: The IP and port of the EchoKit Server you're connecting to. You can use our hosted servers depending on your location:
    - ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US: `ws://indie.echokit.dev/ws`
    - ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° Hong Kong: `ws://hk.echokit.dev/ws`
    - ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ Singapore: TBD
- **Background Image**: Upload a transparent GIF image as the background for the device.

For each field, click the **"Write"** button after entering the value.

After you are done writing all fields, click **K0 button** on the EchoKit Cube device.



## Step 4: Confirm Setup on EchoKit

Once configuration is complete, EchoKit will:

- Display a welcome screen  
- Play a voice greeting like: **"Hi there"**  
- Show a message like: **"Hello Set"**

This means your device is ready to use!


## Step 5: Start Chatting

Press the [**K0 button**] to start your conversation with EchoKit. The status bar at the top of the screen says "Listening ..." and it is ready to respond to you!



If it says "Idle" or "Speaking" in the status bar at the top of the screen, it cannot hear you and would not respond to you. ;) 
* When it's idle, press the K0 button to start chat mode.
* When it's speaking, wait until it finishes before talking.

Enjoy your voice AI journey.
