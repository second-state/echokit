## K0 Button

The **K0 button** (located on the left side of the device) is a multi-purpose control button. It is used when you want to

* Start a conversation and have the device "listen" for you.
* Interrupt or stop when the device is "speaking".

You also need this button when you want to

* Configure WiFi and EchoKit server: Press and hold **K0** when the device is starting up. Restart the device by clicking on **RST**. [Learn more](../quick-start.md)
* Flash the device: Press and hold **RST** and then click on **K0**. [Learn more](flash-firmware.md)
