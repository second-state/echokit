# Quick Start with EchoKit Box

This guide walks you through setting up your **EchoKit Box**, which comes pre-assembled and ready to use.  

> If you would like to get a preview before your EchoKit device arrives, you can use our [web-based EchoKit device simulator](https://echokit.dev/chat/resources/).

## Get familiar with the buttons

Let’s take a moment to get familiar with the common buttons and ports. The image below gives you a clear overview of them. Learn more about [the buttons on EchoKit Box](../hardware/buttons-echokit-box.md).

The buttons on the EchoKit Box is easy to indentify.


## Step 1: Power up EchoKit

Use a **USB Type-C data cable** to connect EchoKit Box to a power source, such as a battery charger or your computer. The USB port is on the back side of the EchoKit box.

You will see the QR code display on the EchoKit screen. 


## Step 2: Connect EchoKit to Your Computer

Open a web browser on a desktop computer and go to:  
👉 [**https://echokit.dev/setup/**](https://echokit.dev/setup/)

> Make sure that your computer has Bluetooth turned ON.

Click **Connect to EchoKit** to begin Bluetooth pairing.




## Step 3: Configure Wi-Fi and Server

Once paired via Bluetooth, you’ll be redirected to a setup interface where you can enter:

- **Wi-Fi Network**: Your Wi-Fi network name. It MUST be a 2.4G network.  
- **Wi-Fi Password**: Your Wi-Fi access code  
- **EchoKit Server**: The IP and port of the EchoKit Server you're connecting to. You can use our hosted servers depending on your location:
    - US: `ws://indie.echokit.dev/ws`
    - Taiwan and southeast Asia: `ws://tw.echokit.dev/ws`
    - Rest of the world: `ws://echokit-server.fly.dev/ws`
    - Everyone: [run your own EchoKit server](echokit-server.md)
- **Background Image (Optional)**: Upload a transparent GIF image (320x240 px) as the background for the EchoKit device.

For each required field, click the **"Save Configuration"** button on the web page after entering the three values (Wi-Fi Network, Wi-Fi Password, and EchoKit Server). If you wish to set a background image, you can upload it as an optional fourth value.

And the EchoKit Box will restart automatically.

## Step 4: Confirm Setup on EchoKit

Once configuration is complete, EchoKit will:

- Display a welcome screen  
- Play a voice greeting like: **"Hi there"**  
- Show a message like: **"Idle"**

This means your device is ready to use!


## Step 5: Start Chatting

Press the **K0 button** to start your conversation with EchoKit. The status bar at the top of the screen says "Listening ..." and it is ready to respond to you!


If it says "Idle", "Waiting" or "Speaking" in the status bar at the top of the screen, it cannot hear you and would not respond to you. ;) 
* When it's idle, press the K0 button to start chat mode.
* When it's speaking, wait until it finishes before talking.

Enjoy your voice AI journey.
