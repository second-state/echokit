### Button Interrupt

You can now **interrupt EchoKitâ€™s speech with a simple K0 button press**, which are located on the left side of the EchoKit device

This makes your voice assistant feel more responsive â€” no need to wait until it finishes talking. Just press the button and start speaking right away!

### Adjustable Volume

Need to make EchoKit quieter? The speaker used to be so loud we couldnâ€™t even test it at night!

You can now **adjust the speaker volume directly on the device**, giving you full control of your experience.

The volume buttons are located on the right side of the device:
* The top button increases the volume.
* The bottom button lowers the volume.

This makes it easy to get the perfect sound level, anytime.


### ðŸš€ How to Update

1. Download the latest version of **Firmware** from our [ESP32 LaunchPad](https://espressif.github.io/esp-launchpad/?flashConfigURL=https://echokit.dev/firmware/echokit.toml).
2. Download the latest version of the server from EchoKit [GitHub release page](https://github.com/second-state/echokit_server/releases/tag/v0.1.2) and rerun it.
3. Flash the firmware to your device.
4. Reconnect the server and device.
   * If youâ€™re using the pre-set server provided by the EchoKit team, thereâ€™s nothing extra you need to do â€” the official server has already been updated to the latest version.
5. Youâ€™re ready to go â€” enjoy your new interactive voice experience!
