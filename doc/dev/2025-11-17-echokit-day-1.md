Many of our customers have already received their **EchoKit**, ready to explore the fascinating world of **voice AI**. To help you become a **Voice AI agent master**, we’re kicking off the **First 30 Days with EchoKit** journey, which works for both [**EchoKit DIY**](https://echokit.dev/echokit_diy.html) and [**EchoKit Box**](https://echokit.dev/echokit_box.html) users.

> Wondering about Day 0? If you have a **DIY EchoKit**, [assemble it first](https://echokit.dev/docs/hardware/assemble-echokit).



### Step 1: Power Up Your EchoKit

The adventure begins the moment you connect your EchoKit to power:

1. Use the **USB Type-C data cable** to connect EchoKit to your computer or a power source.
2. Watch as the device awakens — you should see a **QR code** appear on the screen.
3. Can’t see the QR code? Don’t worry:

   * Click the **RST button** to restart.
   * Immediately press and **hold the K0 button** until the QR code appears.

There it is—the first sign that your EchoKit is coming to life. That tiny screen, those subtle lights—they mark the start of a **new AI companion** ready to talk to you.



### Step 2: Connect EchoKit to Your Computer

Next, it’s time to introduce your EchoKit to the digital world:

1. Open a web browser (Chrome is recommended) on your desktop and go to:
   👉 [https://echokit.dev/setup/](https://echokit.dev/setup/)
2. Click **Connect to EchoKit** to start pairing.

With this connection, your **EchoKit AI assistant** is ready to listen, respond, and learn. This small device is no longer just hardware—it’s now a **voice AI companion** that can interact with you in real time.


### Step 3: Configure Wi-Fi and Server

Once paired, the setup interface will appear. This is where your EchoKit truly becomes yours:

1. Enter the following details:

   * **Wi-Fi Network**: Your 2.4G Wi-Fi name
   * **Wi-Fi Password**: Your access code
   * **EchoKit Server**: Choose a pre-set server for a fast connection:

     * 🇺🇸 US: `ws://indie.echokit.dev/ws`
     * 🇭🇰 EU: `ws://eu.echokit.dev/ws`
       *(Outside these regions? The response may be slower, but it will still work.)*
2. Click **Write** for each field.
3. Once finished, press the **K0 button** on EchoKit.

With every step, you’re not just configuring a device—you’re preparing for your **first conversation with your AI companion**.


### Step 4: Confirm Setup on EchoKit

After configuration, your EchoKit will:

* Display a **welcome screen**
* Play a **voice greeting**: “Hi there”

This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. Your **EchoKit voice AI** is now awake and ready. Take a moment to appreciate it—it’s listening, responding, and ready to become part of your daily life.


### Step 5: Start Chatting

Now comes the fun part: your **first conversation** with EchoKit.

1. Press the **K0 button** to start. The status bar will show **“Listening …”**.
2. Speak to your EchoKit and enjoy its responses.
3. If the status shows **“Idle”** or **“Speaking”**, use the K0 button to start or interrupt as needed.

Every question, every command, every interaction is a **small discovery**. This is the start of your **voice AI journey**, where your EchoKit learns, adapts, and surprises you with each conversation.
