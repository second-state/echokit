Artificial intelligence is no longer science fiction—it’s part of everyday life. From classrooms to workplaces, AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini are being used by millions. But here’s the challenge: most people only interact with these systems as **black boxes**.

If we want to not just *use* AI, but to **understand, customize, and innovate with it**, we need tools that make AI tangible.

That’s why we created EchoKit — an open-source voice AI toolkit that makes learning AI as hands-on as building with LEGO. 

## What is EchoKit?

EchoKit is a **open-source hardware and software toolkit** for building and understanding modern AI voice agents.

* Out of the box, EchoKit is a functional **voice AI device**—a companion you can talk to immediately.
* But its real value lies in what’s inside: a **modular hardware kit, open-source firmware, and an extensible AI server** that together let you learn and experiment with every layer of the system.

With EchoKit, learners and educators can:

* Explore modular hardware design, from microphones and speakers to ESP32-based processors.

* Customize firmware written in Rust and re-flash the device to change how it behaves.

* Run an AI server that connects to OpenAI, Gemini, or local open-source models for speech recognition, text generation, and voice synthesis.

* Experiment with speech-to-text (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines in a real system.

* Build and integrate MCP tools (e.g., knowledge bases, search, or smart-home control) so that the AI agent can perform meaningful actions.

* Learn how voice cloning, accents, and fine-tuned TTS models work, and try personalizing your own agent’s voice.

* Set up local and private AI inference to understand how open-source models like Whisper and Llama can run on your own computer.

* Follow structured guides that gradually explain AI concepts—from neural networks and embeddings to real-time systems—while encouraging experimentation.

In other words, EchoKit is not just a gadget—it is a **practical curriculum in a box**, designed to bring AI education to life.

## Who is it For?

EchoKit is designed for a wide range of learners:

* **Students** — Gain hands-on experience with AI that goes far beyond using apps. Build systems, break them apart, and learn how they work.
* **Teachers & Schools** — Bring AI into the classroom with a platform that combines hardware, software, and clear documentation.
* **Parents** — Provide your children with a meaningful project that blends fun, creativity, and real technical skills.
* **Technologists & Hobbyists** — Experiment with AI voice agents as if they were Lego blocks. Modify, extend, and integrate EchoKit into your own projects.
* **Entrepreneurs** — Prototype AI-powered products quickly, on top of a fully customizable and open-source foundation.

## Why It Matters

According to a 2025 Pew survey, over 80% of American students already use large language models (LLMs) for schoolwork. Yet few understand how these systems actually function.

As Nvidia’s Jensen Huang put it:

> “You won’t lose your job to AI—you’ll lose your job to somebody who uses AI.”

We believe the future belongs to those who don’t just *use* AI, but who can **build and shape it**. EchoKit helps bridge that gap by making AI education **hands-on, practical, and open-source**.
