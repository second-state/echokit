Over the past few days, we’ve been iterating on different parts of EchoKit’s voice pipeline — ASR, LLMs, system prompts, and TTS (including ElevenLabs and Groq).

On Day 19, we switch EchoKit’s **Text-to-Speech provider to Fish.audio**, purely through a configuration change.

No code changes are required.

## What Is Fish.audio

Fish.audio is a modern text-to-speech platform focused on **high-quality, expressive voices** and **fast iteration for developers**.

One notable aspect of Fish.audio is the breadth of available voices. It offers a wide range of voice styles, including voices inspired by public figures, pop culture, and anime culture references, which makes it easy to experiment with playful or character-driven agents.

In addition to preset voices, Fish.audio also supports voice cloning, allowing developers to generate speech in a customized voice when needed.

These features make it particularly interesting for conversational and personality-driven voice AI systems.

EchoKit is designed to be provider-agnostic. As long as a TTS service matches the expected interface, it can be plugged into the system without affecting the rest of the pipeline.

## The Exact Change in `config.toml`

Switching to Fish.audio in EchoKit only requires updating the TTS section in the `config.toml` file:

```toml
[tts]
platform = "fish"
speaker = "03397b4c4be74759b72533b663fbd001"
api_key = "YOUR_FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY"
```

A brief explanation of each field:

* `platform` set to `"fish"` tells EchoKit to use Fish.audio as the TTS provider.
* `speaker` specifies the TTS model ID, which can be obtained from the Fish.audio model detail page.
* `api_key` is the API key used to authenticate with the Fish.audio service.

After restarting the EchoKit server and reconnecting the device, all voice output is generated by Fish.audio.

Everything else remains unchanged:

* ASR stays the same
* The LLM and system prompts stay the same
* Conversation flow and tool calls stay the same

With Fish.audio added to the list of supported TTS providers, EchoKit’s voice layer becomes even more flexible — making it easier to experiment with different voices without reworking the system.
