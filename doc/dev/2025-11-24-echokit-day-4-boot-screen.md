*(And Today, EchoKit Gets a Personality of Its Own)*

In the last three days, we powered up EchoKit, connected it to a local server, and even built the server from source. But today… we’re making it **truly yours**.

Today, we’re going to **customize the boot screen**. Think of it as EchoKit’s wardrobe — the first thing you see when it wakes up. And yes, you can "decorate" it as quirky, cute, or technical as you like.

## 🌱 Why Customize the Boot Screen?
Sure, the default boot screen with the EchoKit logo works fine. But customizing it gives you:

* A personal touch — your EchoKit looks exactly how you want it
* An instant “wow” moment every time it starts
* A glimpse into how flexible and hackable your device really is

## Step 1 — Design Your GIF
Depending on your EchoKit model, use your favorite image editor to create a GIF:

* **EchoKit Box:** 360 × 240 px
* **EchoKit DIY:** 240 × 240 px

Keep the GIF under **15 KB** so it loads smoothly.

## Step 2 — Pair Your EchoKit Device
Go to [https://echokit.dev/setup/](https://echokit.dev/setup/) and click **Connect to Your EchoKit**.

Make sure your device shows the **QR code page**. If it doesn’t:

1. Press the **RST** button
2. Hold the **K0** button until the QR code appears

Now your computer and EchoKit are ready to talk.

## Step 3 — Upload Your GIF
Scroll down to **Set Background**, upload your GIF, and click **Set Background**.

> Pro Tip: It may take a few seconds to apply, so don’t panic if nothing changes instantly.

## Step 4 — Save and Restart
Finally, click **Save Configuration**. Your EchoKit will restart, and… voilà! Your custom boot screen is now the first thing it shows when it wakes up.

Today, EchoKit isn’t just a voice assistant or a server anymore — it’s **your EchoKit**.
