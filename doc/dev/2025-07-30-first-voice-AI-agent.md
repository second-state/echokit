## Building Voice AI Agents

EchoKit allows you to create truly intelligent voicr AI agents by adding knowledge and enabling actions:


1.  **Add knowledge to Gaiabase:** Gaiabase is where you can store and manage the knowledge base for your AI agent, allowing it to have more informed conversations.
2.  **Start MCP server:** The Multi-Capability Platform (MCP) server enables your AI agent to perform various actions.
3.  **Configure EchoKit server to use MCP:** Integrate your AI agent with the MCP.
4.  **Chat:** Engage in more complex conversations with your knowledgeable AI agent.
5.  **Start an action MCP (e.g., sending email):** Explore how your AI agent can interact with the real world.
6.  **Configure EchoKit server to use MCP:** Connect your AI agent to perform specific actions.
7.  **Demo through chat:** See your AI agent perform tasks based on your commands.

This takes you into the realm of AI agents, where your voice AI can not only understand but also act upon your requests, opening up a world of possibilities for automation and intelligent assistance.


## Personalizing Your Voice AI

One of the most exciting features of EchoKit is the ability to personalize your voice AI, even cloning your own voice:


1.  **Create a local VAD (Voice Activity Detection):** Learn about voice detection and processing.
2.  **Configure EchoKit server to use VAD:** Integrate local voice detection into your system.
3.  **Chat:** Experience enhanced voice interaction.
4.  **Clone your own voice:** A truly unique feature that allows your AI agent to speak in your voice.
5.  **Start streaming TTS (Text-to-Speech) server:** Set up your own text-to-speech service.
6.  **Configure EchoKit server to use own TTS:** Connect your custom voice to your AI agent.
7.  **Start server:** Get your personalized voice AI running.
8.  **Chat:** Have conversations with an AI that sounds just like you!

This level of personalization makes your EchoKit truly unique and provides a fascinating insight into speech synthesis technologies.


## The Power of Local AI

EchoKit emphasizes the power of local AI, allowing you to run AI models directly on your device, enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on cloud services:


1.  **Start local ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition):** Run speech recognition models locally.
2.  **Configure EchoKit server to use local ASR:** Integrate local speech recognition into your system.
3.  **Start local LLM (Large Language Model):** Run powerful language models directly on your device.
4.  **Configure EchoKit server to use local LLM:** Connect your local language model to your AI agent.
5.  **Chat:** Experience the speed and privacy of local AI.

This feature is particularly appealing for those concerned about data privacy and interested in the cutting edge of on-device AI processing.
