Have you ever wondered what your AI would sound like with a Southern drawl or a confident Texas accent?

Until now, these premium voices were paid add-ons — but from now, you can try them for free on the EchoKit web demo.

We’ve added diverse, natural accents including Southern, Asian, African, New York, and Texas English, bringing more authenticity and cultural depth to your conversations.
Each voice is expressive and warm, built to sound like a real person rather than a robotic assistant.

### How did we make it 
💬 Clone Your Own Voice

Want something even more personal?
With EchoKit’s new Voice Clone feature, you can record a few samples and let the AI learn your unique tone, rhythm, and emotion.
Your AI can literally speak in your voice, running locally on the EchoKit device — completely private, no cloud dependency.

### From Browser to Device

Once you’ve found your favorite voice, take it further.
EchoKit lets you deploy these voices locally, on-device, without relying on any external API.
Perfect for makers, educators, and AI hobbyists who want full control and real-time interaction.
