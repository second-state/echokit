Have you ever wondered what your AI would sound like with a Southern drawl or a confident Texas accent?

Until now, these premium voices were paid add-ons — but **now you can try them for free** on the EchoKit web demo.

We’ve added diverse, natural accents including **Southern, Asian, African-American, New York, and Texas English**, bringing more authenticity and cultural depth to your conversations.  

Each voice is expressive and warm, built to sound like a real person rather than a robotic assistant.
